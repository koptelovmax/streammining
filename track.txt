08.03 13:15-21:00
AdaBoost
RoC/AuC curve
AUC Boosting - ask?
CVFDT algorithm
tau/tie treshold
fix my implementation (R, tau)
compare MOA with my implementation (Churn_8_attributes.arff)

09.03 13:30-19:45
read about active leaves/nodes/tree depth in MOA book
understand depth/leaves/nodes and implement

10.03 13:50
read article and presentation


think about reimplementation of Htree general


start implementation of CVFDT


tried reference/MOA implementation and compared with mine

13.03 15:30-20:00
Try reference implementation
 - Python 3.5
 - pip3 install sortedcontainers

14.03 12:00-19:00
make it working
revise the method of counting examples seen and check it in my code

15.03 12:30-18:20
find differences between my code/reference and MOA

16.03 13:00-20:30
how to perform split? draw some examples
who is right? try to do it

17.03 12:15-18:30
make my code working and compare it with MOA
should store all possible combinations? probably not
Look into reference code (how to reimplement HTree general?)

20.03 13:00
should store all possible combinations? impossible
copystat version (v35_copystat)
Gini split criterion

try weka library directly in python:
	- download & unzip JPype1-0.6.2.tar
	- cmd: python setup.py install

try Tutorial 2 in Java in order to set some parameters
try to output some information

24.03 meeting with supervisers

27.03 15:00-20:15
compare my implementation and MOA in Java

28.03 13:45-21:30
moa.classifiers.core.attributeclassobservers
made my "own" split criterion
found difference b/w my implementation and MOA and fixed it:
 - how to count Gain: Entropy(real number of examples) - Entropy(examples seen after last split)
 - do not take into account leaves with zero statistics
printing of the tree

29.03 15:00-18:00
make github repository

30.30 14:00-17:00
start CVFDT implementation

31.03 14:00-18:30
continue implementation

next:

consider normal VFDT with forget example mechanism
read original paper, book and MOA book again 

continue implementation
generate sample with changing distribution

how to select delta/tau correctly(automaticaly)?
