08.03 13:15-21:00
AdaBoost
RoC/AuC curve
AUC Boosting
CVFDT algorithm
tau/tie treshold
fix my implementation (R, tau)
compare MOA with my implementation (Churn_8_attributes.arff)

09.03 13:30-19:45
read about active leaves/nodes/tree depth in MOA book
understand depth/leaves/nodes and implement

10.03 13:50
read article and presentation


think about reimplementation of Htree general


start implementation of CVFDT


tried reference/MOA implementation and compared with mine

13.03 15:30-20:00
Try reference implementation
 - Python 3.5
 - pip3 install sortedcontainers

14.03 12:00-19:00
make it working
revise the method of counting examples seen and check it in my code

15.03 12:30-18:20
find differences between my code/reference and MOA

16.03 13:00-20:30
how to perform split? draw some examples
who is right? try to do it

17.03 12:15-18:30
make my code working and compare it with MOA
should store all possible combinations? probably not
Look into reference code (how to reimplement HTree general?)

20.03 13:00
should store all possible combinations? impossible
copystat version (v35_copystat)
Gini split criterion

24.03 meeting with supervisers

27.03 15:00-20:15
compare my implementation and MOA in Java

28.03 13:45-21:30
moa.classifiers.core.attributeclassobservers
made my "own" split criterion
found difference b/w my implementation and MOA and fixed it:
 - how to count Gain: Entropy(real number of examples) - Entropy(examples seen after last split)
 - do not take into account leaves with zero statistics
printing of the tree

29.03 15:00-18:00
make github repository

30.30 14:00-17:00
start CVFDT implementation

31.03 14:00-18:30
continue implementation

03.04 13:00-18:00
consider normal VFDT with forget example mechanism
review original paper

04.04 13:00-16:30
review book and MOA book again 

05.04 15:00-17:30
check Mining Decision Trees from Data Streams presentation
Hoeffding Adaptive Tree (which implemented in MOA) is improved Hoeffding Window Tree
differences  of Hoeffding Adaptive Trees with CVFDT

06.04 13:30-18:30
search for Hoeffding Adaptive Trees papers
review what I found
review Hoeffding Window Tree (MOA book, p.134-135)
look into MOA's Hoeffding Adaptive Trees Java code

07.04 13:00-18:00
read about ADWIN0 in MOA book (p.119)
decide what to implement
summarise everything in one algorithm which will be implemented next (p.135)

10.04 14:15-20:45
poker dataset test on htree_general.py
fixed R=round(log2(N_classes))
bug with counting leaves and nodes is detected (no adjustment of number of values attributes have)

next:
test poker dataset on HoeffdingAdaptiveTree in MOA
try to detect changes in MOA (analise depth of the tree or draw tree in Java?)

generate sample with concept drift (changing distribution) and test it
start implementation of HoeffdingAdaptiveTree in my setting

think about my own algorithm

how to select delta/tau correctly(automaticaly)?
